#set doesn't support dupblicate values
#set doesn't remember the order of the elements
#Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

#syntax of set is below as we declare in matematics
#If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.
#Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.
#The del keyword will delete the set completely:

set = {'shubham',6,1,2,2,3,3,4,5}
eval()
print(set)
